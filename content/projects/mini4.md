# Serverless Rust Microservice

This project involves creating a serverless microservice using Rust, specifically designed to run as an AWS Lambda function or on AWS App Runner. The service will connect to a database, showcasing the integration capabilities of serverless applications with persistent storage.


## Requirements

- **Rust AWS Lambda Function/App Runner**: Develop a microservice using Rust that can be deployed as either an AWS Lambda function or on AWS App Runner, leveraging the serverless computing environment to manage infrastructure.
- **Simple Service Implementation**: The Rust application should implement a straightforward service logic that demonstrates effective request handling, business logic processing, and response generation.
- **Database Connection**: Incorporate database connectivity within the service to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, highlighting how serverless applications interact with databases.


## Deliverables

- **Rust Code**: The complete source code of the Rust microservice, including all necessary configurations for deployment on AWS Lambda or AWS App Runner and the code required for database interactions.
- **Screenshots/Demo Video**: Visual evidence of the successful invocation of the service. This could be in the form of screenshots showing the service's response to a request or a demo video walking through the service's functionality.
- **Writeup Explaining the Service**: A comprehensive explanation covering the service's purpose, architecture, and how it meets the project requirements. This writeup should detail the steps taken to develop the service, challenges encountered, and how they were overcome.
